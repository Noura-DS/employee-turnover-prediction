# employee-turnover-prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify the key factors that contribute to employee turnover at Salifort Motors and build predictive models to classify employees likely to leave the project simulates real-world data analytics workflow, including stakeholder-facing deliverables.

## Problem Statement
Salifort Motors is experiencing a high employee turnover rate so the goal is to build a model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company and uncover key insights that can inform retention strategies.

## Dataset
it consists of 15,000 employees and 10 features and the target variable is `left` (1 = left the company, 0 = stayed)

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC AUC

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Previous Labs in the course
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control
